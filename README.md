Known Issues
============
- Currently it display only tweets with geo informations, so tweets without geo are not displayed on the map. (Optionally we can dig the location from user profile, becase twitter is fallbacking to that info, if the geo is not present. But I have found it very unreaible.)
- Cross browser compatibility of the info window. (maybe move to table..)
